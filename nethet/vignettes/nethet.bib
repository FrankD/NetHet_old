	abstract = {Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present {ARACNE}, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods.

	abstract = {The proper functioning of any living cell relies on complex networks of gene regulation. These regulatory interactions are not static but respond to changes in the environment and evolve during the life cycle of an organism. A challenging objective in computational systems biology is to infer these time-varying gene regulatory networks from typically short time series of transcriptional profiles. While homogeneous models, like conventional dynamic Bayesian networks, lack the flexibility to succeed in this task, fully flexible models suffer from inflated inference uncertainty due to the limited amount of available data. In the present paper we explore a semi-flexible model based on a piecewise homogeneous dynamic Bayesian network regularized by gene-specific inter-segment information sharing. We explore different choices of prior distribution and information coupling and evaluate their performance on synthetic data. We apply our method to gene expression time series obtained during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster, and compare the predicted segmentation with other state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude our evaluation with an application to synthetic biology, where the objective is to predict an in vivo regulatory network of five genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to a changing environment.},

	abstract = {The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ({FGFR}2) locus has been consistently identified as a breast cancer risk locus in independent genome-wide association studies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying {FGFR}2-mediated risk are still unknown. Using model systems we show that {FGFR}2-regulated genes are preferentially linked to breast cancer risk loci in expression quantitative trait loci analysis, supporting the concept that risk genes cluster in pathways. Using a network derived from 2,000 transcriptional profiles we identify {SPDEF}, {ERα}, {FOXA}1, {GATA}3 and {PTTG}1 as master regulators of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling, and show that {ERα} occupancy responds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling. Our results indicate that {ERα}, {FOXA}1 and {GATA}3 contribute to the regulation of breast cancer susceptibility genes, which is consistent with the effects of anti-oestrogen treatment in breast cancer prevention, and suggest that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling has an important role in mediating breast cancer risk.},

Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes ({TP}53, {PIK}3CA and {GATA}3) occurred at {\textgreater}10\% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in {GATA}3, {PIK}3CA and {MAP}3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a {HER}2/phosphorylated {HER}2/{EGFR}/phosphorylated {EGFR} signature within the {HER}2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm—the graphical lasso—that is remarkably fast: It solves a 1000-node problem (∼500000 parameters) in at most a minute and is 30–4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from proteomics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4989},
	abstract = {We consider penalized estimation in hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) with multivariate Normal observations. In the moderate-to-large dimensional setting, estimation for {HMMs} remains challenging in practice, due to several concerns arising from the hidden nature of the states. We address these concerns by l1-penalization of state-specific inverse covariance matrices. Penalized estimation leads to sparse inverse covariance matrices which can be interpreted as state-specific conditional independence graphs. Penalization is non-trivial in this latent variable setting; we propose a penalty that automatically adapts to number of states K and state-specific sample size and can cope with scaling issues arising from the unknown states. The methodology is adaptive and very general, applying in particular to both low- and high-dimensional settings without requiring hand tuning. Furthermore, our approach facilitates exploration of the number of states K by coupling estimation for successive candidate values K. Empirical results on simulated examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In a challenging real data example from genome biology, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to yields gains in predictive power and deliver richer estimates than existing methods.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4584},
	abstract = {We propose novel methodology for testing equality of model parameters between two high-dimensional populations. The technique is very general and applicable to a wide range of models. The method is based on sample splitting: the data is split into two parts; on the first part we reduce the dimensionality of the model to a manageable size; on the second part we perform significance testing (p-value calculation) based on a restricted likelihood ratio statistic. Assuming that both populations arise from the same distribution, we show that the restricted likelihood ratio statistic is asymptotically distributed as a weighted sum of chi-squares with weights which can be efficiently estimated from the data. In high-dimensional problems, a single data split can result in a "p-value lottery". To ameliorate this effect, we iterate the splitting process and aggregate the resulting p-values. This multi-split approach provides improved p-values. We illustrate the use of our general approach in two-sample comparisons of high-dimensional regression models ("differential regression") and graphical models ("differential network"). In both cases we show results on simulated data as well as real data from recent, high-throughput cancer studies.},
